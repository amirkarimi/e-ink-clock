# e-Ink Clock

This is the source code used for building a DIY clock using [Inky's wHAT e-Ink display](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-what).

## Test

```
poetry install
poetry shell
python clock.py debug
```

It shows the rendered image like this:

## Setup

I used [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) so I had to solder the header pins and then connect it to the display. It wasn't hard and there are a few tutorial for it. I also installed a minimal terminal only Pi OS and connected on it using SSH but there are other ways to do work with your Pi.

To deploy on your Raspberry Pi:

1. Install Inky's: `curl https://get.pimoroni.com/inky | bash`
1. Copy [clock.py](clock.py) and [fonts](./fonts) folder (or only the used font in the script) to your Pi
1. Setup cron to run it every minute:
    - `sudo crontab -e`
    - Add this line at the end of the opened file and save it: `* * * * * python {clock.py-absolute-path}`
1. You've got a clock and a script that can update its display. Limitation is your imagination!
